Wide QuestLog
=============

Wide Questlog is a World of Warcraft Classic addon that doubles the width of the 
QuestLog UI panel to give you a better overview of your quests when your log is 
full.

This addon is fork and re-release of the discontinued addon "DoubleWide" 
(https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6887-DoubleWide.html)

It fixes the faulty window behavior where the QuestLog frame would not be 
considered doublewide and have other windows like the Character frame overlap 
the right side of the window. Now it cascades the windows properly.
